# GridSearchNew
A new module to apply grid search for tuning hyperparameters in machine learning algorithms 

When we fit a classifier, it is a common practice to supply the `class_weight` parameter, which reflects our belief that misclassifying an observation in the positive class as negative does not have the same penalty as the reverse case. Typically, `estimator`s in `scikit-learn` allow users to specify `class_weight` as a parameter. When this happens, the classifier should be evaluated using the corresponding `class_weight` as well. However, the current [`GridSearchCV`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html) function in `scikit-learn`, a popular tool for evaluating models of various configurations (combinations of hyperparameters) and selecting the best possible model, fails to take the `class_weight` into consideration. In order to remedy this deficiency, the `GridSearchCVNew` module has been written and consider `class_weight` when the model is both fitted and evaluated.
